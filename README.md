# machine-learning
#This machine learning project is on k means clustering.K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into  ùëò k clusters. Here, we will apply it to group customers based on their purchase history for a retail store.

Explanation of the Code:
Data Preparation: We created a sample dataset with customer purchase history.
Feature Selection: Selected Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) as the features for clustering.
Normalization: Used StandardScaler to normalize the features.
K-means Clustering: Applied K-means clustering with 3 clusters.
Evaluation: Evaluated the clustering using inertia and silhouette score.
Visualization: Visualized the clusters using a scatter plot.


#This machine learning project is on hand recognition using development tools anfd frameworks like python,jupyter notebook,tensorflow and keras.

Explanation of the code:
Data Collection: Use public datasets or create your own.
Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment data.
Model Building: Design a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
Training: Train the model with augmented data.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance on validation data.
Deployment: Save the model and create a Flask API for deployment.
